Scripts are better to be stored on a directory where administrators could excecute them too

Linux has a FHS (Filesystem Hierarchy Standard) that describes the conventions used for each directory 
in an UNIX system. (clarifies their purpose)

The bin directory is where scripts are supposed to be located
/user/local/bin

for example, for the update script:
/user/local/bin/update

The command chown root:root changes the user and group of the specified file or directory to user root and group root. 
changing the ownership to user:group of /user/local/bin/update
sudo chown root:root /user/local/bin/update

.sh is actually not needed, that's why it's only called update

and you can type "update" on the console and the script will execute as it already knows (due $PATH) that the path is where it's supposed to be 

It knows because there's a variable $PATH which contains the environment variables so it searchs for the Scripts
on all those directories

You can add more paths to the env using as it saves the already existing directories and adds the new directory 
(assuming we're adding /usr/local/bin)
export PATH =/usr/local/bin:$PATH
