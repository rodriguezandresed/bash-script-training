The best practice is to add the fully qualified 
path to each command so you know it's a scripteable command

for example: /usr/bin/echo

remember you can use which command to find the path AND if it's installed

This is done because cron runs a job, it MAY not be run on a shell environment
Also for security so you don't get swapped malicious commands

You can edit your crontab using:

crontab -e

if you don't use sudo, you're editing your user's cron tab

the sintax is:

m h dom mon dow command
30 3 10 7 4 /usr/local/bin/scheduling_script.sh

once you use the crontab command, crontab creates a new crontab

you can edit a certain user's crontab using:

sudo crontab -u username -e
